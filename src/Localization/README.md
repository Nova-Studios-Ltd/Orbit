# Localization Guidelines

Localization IDs are in the format of "[Component Type]_[Component Functionality]-[Name]"

For example: "TextField_Label-Password"

- The [Component Functionality] part clarifies the context of what the string will say (e.g. in a TextField, you can have different strings for the placeholder, label, etc.), and is optional if the component only has a single distinct purpose.
